# Machine Learning for Crime Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a thesis that explores the applicability of machine learning models in crime analysis and prediction. The study focuses on Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) models. The dataset used is sourced from the Los Angeles Police Department and covers various crime types.

## Objectives

- Evaluate Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and KNN models for crime analysis and prediction.
- Utilize a diverse dataset from the Los Angeles Police Department.

## Results

The research outcomes reveal variations in model performance. SVM emerges as the most accurate model, achieving an impressive 78% accuracy in distinguishing "property" from "violent" offenses. Random Forest and KNN exhibit strengths in specific areas, highlighting the importance of aligning model selection with specific needs.

## Key Findings

- SVM is identified as the most accurate model for crime type classification.
- Random Forest and KNN offer unique advantages in different contexts.
- Consideration of specific needs is crucial in model selection.

## Implications

The study underscores the potential of machine learning in enhancing proactive crime prevention and law enforcement strategies. The findings suggest that future research should explore temporal elements and incorporate socio-economic characteristics to further improve prediction accuracy.

## Recommendations

- Future studies should investigate temporal aspects to enhance crime prediction.
- Integration of socio-economic features could contribute to more accurate forecasts.

## Contributions

This research lays the groundwork for advancements in applying machine learning to efficient crime analysis and prediction. It provides valuable insights for developing proactive crime prevention strategies.
